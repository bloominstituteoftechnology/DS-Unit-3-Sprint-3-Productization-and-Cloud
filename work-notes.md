DAY 1

1) I learned a lot, as always, after some level of frustration, as always.  Im getting better at taking things apart, so thats good.  Just wish I could constuct equally as well :'D

2) I thought the most interesting part of this was the flash SQL replacement thingie, looking over it is pretty awesome.

3) The most challenging part was figuring out why my enviroment was giving me syntax errors until I ran the same code 3 times.  We never did figure it out but after an exit and restart it happened less often so hooray!


DAY 2

1) Ive learned to make smaller commits and test them out.  Writing a whole file out of hand just to have a syntax error say its somewhere in these 3 files is kind of annoying, but anything is a lesson from a certain angle :D 

2)The most interesting part of this assignment was the raw output in the terminal of the predictions.  It really brought together what seemed like a very broad lecture and made the variables seem more sensible.

3) So far the most challenging part is chasing down this syntax error!  it cant be the "else:" so it must be in either the try: or the app.py that references it I think.  Ill get there!


DAY 3

1) I dont understand much about how the buttons work, but I got it looking nice and got it to work.  Honestly most of what I learned was how to make stuff work on windows...

2)the most interesting part of this day was finally getting the app to work and be able to add buttons and css functionality to it, theres really a  whole world of stuff to do with it.

3)The most challenging part is just this being a completely alien experience.  Past the initial setup, its so openended, I can appreciate making these to be a whole thing in itself 


DAY 4

1)Ive learned how to fight with windows to get things pushed to heroku, and although it isnt completely done (gunicorn especially is giving grief)  I understand the steps and will hit it over this weekend or even friday afternoon.

2)The coolest thing today was seeing the end in sight; the actual app page, updating every time i pushed something.  With enough work this could become a very impressive project!

3)The most challenging part was windows things again, but I think im getting better at fixing it at least.
