# please find attached link to heroku app

Please note the heroku link has a slightly later version of the app than the repo as I updated it to only use requests instead of import openaq and added some links in the base html

https://thebarebones.herokuapp.com/

also here is the link i used to get the heroku app up and running as I couldn't seem to link it to jsut a subdirectory of a repo

https://github.com/danhorsley/barebones/tree/master/minirun
