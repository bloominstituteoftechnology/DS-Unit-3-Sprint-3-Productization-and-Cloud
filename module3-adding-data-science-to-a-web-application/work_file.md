What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? 

I completed reproducing the lecture activities from assignment two and began working on rewatching 
Module 3's recorded lecture. A fellow classmate suggested doing that prior to attempting to write methods 
to pull actual users and tweets or writing an embedding field in my twiter model.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today? 
Nothing was really overly interesting or surprising, but I learned the importance of reading what you 
typed prior to hitting enter. However, I think I may have found my niche in data science. This whole 
unit has been more exciting and thrilling to learn than any of the previous units.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Having to rewrite command line code due to typos, and then finding out it was actually in my editor.
Backtracking to a point where the code works correctly without errors.
It is more tedious than challenging.
