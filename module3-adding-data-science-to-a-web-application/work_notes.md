What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    Model fitting and manipulating the output to roll into a method on the app was intuitive.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    So far we've shared the singular outputs of models, rather than incorporating a model
    directly into an application and having the model retrain and re-evaluate multiple times.
    The model being an active element of the app was a nice change.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    HTML and forms - I just haven't had much exposure to it beyond playing with 
    inspect element.
