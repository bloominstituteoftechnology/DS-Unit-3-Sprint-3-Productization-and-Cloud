- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?  
    was able to reproduce the lecture and get the predictive modeling to display correctly.  
- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?  
   Just added onto the previous days. Was cool to see an element of the Data science added, not just the development side.  
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?  
   cant get the last part of the assignment to work correctly. Cant get the logic to work where a form is used to create a new user and add those tweets to a database.
