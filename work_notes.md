Note - assignments this week are all steps in a larger week-long project. They are to be worked on in a repo you make with your own account, as instructed in the first day. You should still fork this repo, and open a PR where you add a work_notes.md file that includes a link to your project repo. You should then update work_notes.md each day with the following:

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I could replicate the results that we derived in during the live lecturre class.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
This was a totally new stuff for me. I enjoyed it. I liked learning about front end/back end and creating data bases.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Understanding the work flow. Knowing how each piece was important and what were we trying to achieve. I still have to understand how flask is being used then how everyhting is coming together (from creating different .py files to making it run/work).
