Notes for Tuesday, 2019-03-05

    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    **A**: I enjoyed seeing the web app slowly "coming together" with continued individual effort to deploy.
        
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    **A**: I found the python-decouple bits noteworthy because I had previously deployed Twitter-focused
    modules to github with sensitive keys--successfully, I believe--using only github's .gitignore
    functionality.
    
    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    **A**: Today's work was most challenging in its shear number of methods and objects that had to
    be created and/or used. So many "moving parts" today, so to speak.

    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
