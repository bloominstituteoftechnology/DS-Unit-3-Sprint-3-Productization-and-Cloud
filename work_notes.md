Monday

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? Getting everything working with Windows environment was a bit different than the lecture, but it went okay and had no problems with the assignment.  

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today? I really like the accessibility of SQLAlchemy. I can see how you would automate DB creation, editing, etc with clearly defined classes. 
Much easier than writing a bunch of query modules. More efficient too.  

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? Just getting it working with Windows. Lots of little tweaks here and there.

Tuesday

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? It was pretty straightforward I thought, just a bunch of reading documentation.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today? Mmmm, I really like the embeddings and the ease in gathering/storing tweet history.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? As usual, making it all work on Win10.


Wed,

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? Today figuring out how to get the log regression working with the app was really easy, I was expecting it to be a real pain, but it wasn't. Was pleasantly surprised.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today? I guess having never really worked with API's before, it was eye-opening to see how much faster your prototyping is with a built method for accessing data versus scraping it.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? Uhhh, well, i'm using a different deployment/distribution than the lecture, so figuring out how to handle dependencies and the like was challenging.
