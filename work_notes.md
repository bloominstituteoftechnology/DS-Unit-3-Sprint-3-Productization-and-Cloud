*Module 1*

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Reproduced the steps from lecture: write and run a basic local Flask web application.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Ben Manning's thorough overview on deployment was very informative!

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Took time to find the correct Windows syntax from the command line.  
Another good exercise was getting my pipenv configuration in order and understanding why/how it works.

*Module 2*

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Following along with the lecture from Bruno Janota, managed to write methods to pull Users and Tweets.  
Including adding an embedding field in my Tweet model.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Interaction with both Twitter and Basilica API is quite smooth.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Had some troubles setting up my local/pipenv environment, SQLAlchemy in particular gave some headaches.  
Interaction between the module 1 lecture from Ben Manning and the prerecorded module 2 lecture from Bruno Janota was not seamless. 

*Module 3*

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Reproduced the lecture, added forms to compare/add users.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Doing a logistic regression on the Basilica embeddings is very intereseting.  

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Debugging my code, to figure out the what/where/why from the error messages.

*Module 4*

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

Deployed my app!

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Evaluating model performance (and by doing so, being able to compare different models) is not straight forward.  

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Debugging Heroku can be quite challenging.
