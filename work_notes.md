Notes for Monday, 2019-03-04

    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    **A**: Flask, once set up properly, just _works_. I love it.
    
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    **A**: Aaron G's use of Docker was great to watch.
    
    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    **A**: Making all the 'machine connections'--by this, I mean writing all the correct programs with
    correct syntax and which make correct programmatic connects [via import, etc] with each other.

Notes for Tuesday, 2019-03-05

    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    **A**: I enjoyed seeing the web app slowly "coming together" with continued individual effort to deploy.
        
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    **A**: I found the python-decouple bits noteworthy because I had previously deployed Twitter-focused
    modules to github with sensitive keys--successfully, I believe--using only github's .gitignore
    functionality.
    
    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    **A**: Today's work was most challenging in its shear number of methods and objects that had to
    be created and/or used. So many "moving parts" today, so to speak.

Notes for Wednesday, 2019-03-06

    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    **A**: During OpenClassroom, I received assistance from TK and SL.  
        
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    **A**: I was very interested in the UI for the logistic regression happening on the backend.  
    
    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    **A**: [Much] Assembly required!  
    
Notes for Thursday, 2019-03-07

    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    **A**: During lecture, I got Windows 10-specific support in troubleshooting issues in my app. 
        
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    **A**: I was, and remain, impressed with the robust functioning of Heroku.  
    
    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    **A**: As with the previous 3 days this week, there were somewhat significant time barriers to
    implementing this project. Some suggestions: I concur with AG's statement regarding standardization
    of workflow by having all students build a VM in advance so that all syntax is the same for everyone
    regardless of local machine OS.
    Also, it may be beneficial to add some portion of this week's Sprint into the Intro Course material.
