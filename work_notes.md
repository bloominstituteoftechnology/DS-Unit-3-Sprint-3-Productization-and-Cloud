    What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    
I was able to reproduce what Aaron coded during the lecture.
    
    What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I found it interesting learning how to make a .env file to hide sensitive variables while still being able to use them.

    What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

The most challenging part of the work today was debugging. For a while I was getting an error and couldn't figure out what was causing it. After making several attempts to solve it, I finally figured out thanks to a response from a classmate that I had written one of the variables in my twitter.py app incorrectly. Once I corrected it, I no longer received the error and was able to continue with my work reproducing the lecture.
