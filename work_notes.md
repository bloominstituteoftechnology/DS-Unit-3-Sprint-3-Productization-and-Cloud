Day: module 1 
1) Took some time and troubleshotting but i was able to replicate the lecture and complete 
todays homework. 

2) The location of files in what folder is very important

3) The most challenging part for today was pipenv installing packages pycopg2 wouldnt install 
but i was able to find a work around. 

Day: module 2
1) Completed todays assignments with minimal troubleshotting.

2) It doesn't look like a lot of code, however the code is quite sufisticated.

3) There was a lot to take in that you couldn't dive in depth to why certain things are done. Need to accept thats just how its done.

Day: module 3
1) The assignment worked today on the first try

2) How all the independent files come together to get the final product to work as intended.

3) The most challenging part about today was following along there was a lot of code that refrencced different locations. It become confusing at times. 

Day: module 4 
1) the app worked one the first try 

2) Its kinda straight forward to deploy an app on heroku after you have it developed locally

3) The most difficult part about today was making sure you imported things correctly to heroku to make it work.
