# 11/11/2019 (module 1)
1. What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- Creating the flask app, adding user and tweet classes, creating all the required files, working with flask in the command line, submitting request to work with the Twitter API. Basically, the whole assingment went well.
2. What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- Basilica looks interesting, though I haven't dug deeper than surface-level yet.
3. What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- Being okay with not understanding why we need every specific file for setting up the flask app and what each one does. It's challenging because a lot of the names for the modules and classes are similar. I might be getting terms mixed up.

# 11/12/2019 (module 2)
1. What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- Using Twitter/Basilica API, repopulating the database with real users and tweets
2. What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- Basilica makes embeddings super easy. I'm excited to pull more data from twitter
3. What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- simple syntax errors, because I couldn't see them right away

# 11/13/2019 (module 3)
1. What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- making functions for predictions, connecting the flask framework to html files, and deploying locally
2. What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- found out that html still reads comments, so had to delete them
3. What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- bugs, because I didn't know that the comments in the html files were what was wrong

# 11/14/2019 (module 4)
1. What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- deploying to heroku, using heroku from the command line, looking at heroku logs when errors were thrown
2. What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- it's cool how easy it is to use gunicorn, and that heroku can automatically set up a postgresql database for you
3. What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- Understanding how heroku really works. I get the overall ideas. I'm spending time looking up what exactly everything is (caching, microframeworks, etc.)
