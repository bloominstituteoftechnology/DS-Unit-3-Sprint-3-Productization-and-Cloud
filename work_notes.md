**What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?**
Working with Flask is relatively straight forward. 

**What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?**
I was happy to learn how to access functions from files in the same directory with 
.<file_name> because this is something I was previously struggling to figure out.

**What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?**
The most challenging part was figuring out the Windows alternatives to the
bash commands.
