# **Daily project review:**

## Monday 03/04

**What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?**
- I was able to follow along for most of the lecture before things started blowing up. I was able to get
most of the assignment completed.

**What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?**
- I am not sure because I was just doing the assignment and not really absorbing the concepts.


**What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?**
- I am still confused on some of the "why's and how's". Like why do I need to run the Flask shell and what is it doing for me.
I want to read about this stuff but there is just no time, since the assignments take a lot of time for me.
