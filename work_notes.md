# Day 1: web app development with flask
- **what went well**

  - Got everything to run correctly (I think). I can populate database with new inputs.  I can connect the flask app to the server and get the hello world app to run. 

- **what was particularly interesting about the topic today?**

  - It is pretty cool to experience how easy it can be to get a quick flask app up and running.  Pretty powerful.  

- **What was the most challenging part about the work today, and why?**

  - Understanding how the package works together is the difficult part for me.  Still not sure how flask makes it easy to connect to a server 
to run the app in the file.  It all still feels like magic to me. 

# Day 2: consuming data from an API
- **what went well**

  - Was able to connect to twitter and basilica API.  I fetched tweets from Austen and my own twitter account, which was pretty cool to see.  I also was able to embed the tweets and get them into the database.  I also added an user route and a link to it, which was tricky, but works for now.  Lastly I experimented with picnin css to make the pages look somewhat nicer.
  
- **what was particularly interesting about the topic today?**

  - The fact that you can extract information from such a huge database like twitter is unbelievable to me.  Also what basilica does is pretty amazing as well.  We haven't built the model yet, but the fact that those embeddings will be able to tell how similar certain tweets are, is pretty cool.  I can see how useful something like that can be for many different types of applications.
  
- **what was the most challenging part about the work today, and why?**

  - Getting used to how the routes work was pretty tricky. I had to do a lot of searching on my own, to figure out how flask works.  Making the correct references was hard to intuitively figure out.  Eventually I got something to run though.
  
# Day 3: Adding Data Science to web app
- **what went well**

  - Ultimately the app was able to run with a simple regression fed into it.  It can update correctly. I think. You can add users.  And compare them to see who is most likely to say a certain tweet.  
  
- **what was particularly interesting about the topic today?**

  - It is cool to see a basic way in which a predictive model can be used within an app.  
  
- **what was the most challenging part about the work today, and why?**

  - Figuring out how flask connects everything together canbe tricky. Especially when setting new routes and making them work well with layouts to display exactly what you want.  A little mispelling or mis-named variable can throw you into a loop as well.
  
# Day 4: Deplying Web app on Heroku
- **what went well**

  - The app is fully deployed and works well. Sent link to some people, and no one had issues with the expected capabilities. So that is cool.  
  
- **what was particularly interesting about the topic today?**

  - The fact that people anywhere in the world can see what I have created after today is pretty amazing to me.  I know the internet has made this possible for a while now. But creating an app from scratch (kind of) and deploying it, and having it work is pretty gratifying.
  
- **What was the most challengning part about the work today, and why?**

  - Debugging the deployment of the heroku app is hard.  Mostly because I am not used to the errors that it spits out at me.  I am sure with more experience, the intuition of where things are going wrong will improve. But to begin with, it felt like hitting a bunch of road blocks with no detour signs easily available.  Making sure that the right environment is set up for the app is pretty tricky to for me.  All things that are hard to grasp when it is the first time being exposed to them.
