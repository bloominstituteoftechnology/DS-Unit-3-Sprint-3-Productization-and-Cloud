# Monday
What was shown in lecture today was fairly easy to reproduce, but the "Assignment" made zero sense.

## Assignment

- Reproduce the steps from lecture: write and run a basic local Flask web
  application


# Tuesday
Only after today's lecture does the assignment from yesterday make any sense
- Create a model for `Tweet` and `User` as demonstrated in lecture, and populate
  your local (SQLite) database with some invented data (at least 6 Tweets and 2
  Users)
