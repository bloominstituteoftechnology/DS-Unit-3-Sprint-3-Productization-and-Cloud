# Work Notes for Lambda Data Science Unit 3, Sprint 3
[Twitoff repo](https://github.com/srfinley/twitoff)

## Module one

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I managed to successfully follow along with today's lecture. Everything else fell naturally from that.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
This is an interesting addition of depth to the stuff that got kind of glossed over when I was building the Plotly Dash app last unit.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
psychopg caused problems for me and some of the rest of the cohort. The source of the problem was not explained and we were told to use an alternate version of the package without a clear sense of the tradeoffs that might be involved in a decision like that. This was frustrating.

## Module two

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
No conceptual issues. Had all the API access in place in advance.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Really liked the .env business. Definitely a cooler solution that my earlier ".py file the name of which is in the gitignore" fix.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Ran into a stupid bug fairly early on in the lecture that somewhat stymied my ability to follow along. Once it was settled, it appeared I hadn't messed up anything substantial when I was following blind. Bad focus during assignment time, in large part due to ambivalence about today's particular stretch goals.

## Module three

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Most things. Even adding a few little stretches (extra nav buttons, left margin, percent probability) went smoothly.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Starting to get a feel for how an app like this is structured. It's interesting!

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Because I did a little stretch yesterday that almost overlapped with today's naming, I had to scramble to undo that to avoid problems. Unpleasant experience. 

## Module four

### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
It deployed to heroku with minimal issues.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Finding out all the shit I was apparently supposed to be magically absorbing during the frantic two-hour codealongs.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Coping emotionally with how little I've learned this week.
