## Module 1 - Web Application Development with Flask
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Overall, the assignment was pretty easy, but I'm interested to see how we can use the
HTML templates and front-end business to make our websites prettier.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
It's amazing how flexible Flask and SQLAlchemy are and I never imagined that we could
use SQLAlchemy to write OOP-based SQL structuring.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The work wasn't very challenging after following Alex Kim's lecture since he was able
to bring a lot of the topics from the lecture into a more holistic point-of-view
and explained a lot of what was going on as he progressed through the project.

## Module 2 - Consuming Data from an API
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
The lecture was very easy to follow and Aaron did well into going in-depth and
explaining the design decisions as he went along.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
It was fun to think about different ways to implement the functions in the
`twitter.py` file. I was also able to finish the stretch goal of implementing
the `/user/<name>` route.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The most challenging part was figuring out the new route for each user and
implementing the logic to interact with the database.

## Module 3 - Adding Data Science to a Web Application
### What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I didn't have to debug much aside from some very small problems, and following along
with the lecture was fairly straightforward. I was also able to make a full clone of
the published app available [here](http://twitoff.herokuapp.com/) by analyzing the
template structure and implementing the necessary routes and HTML.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
I think caching the models with Redis is something that can take the project from a
pet project to a more scalable project since it doesn't have to do the work of
generating the model for every comparison if the model has already been trained. I'm
interested in learning more about it and maybe implementing it into the project.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The most challenging part was writing the new routes and getting the data to display
on the page according to the route.

## Module 4 - Web Application Deployment
