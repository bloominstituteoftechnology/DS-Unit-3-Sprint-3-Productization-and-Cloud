# module 1 
### What went well:
I feel like I learned a lot today and understand the basics of how Flask works and why we want to use it.
### What was particularly interesting or suprising about the topic(s) today:
I am really excited about learning how to make an web application and integrating it with machine learning models. I think this will be extremely useful in my career when it comes to sharing my work with others.
### Most challenging part:
There are a lot of different parts, and understanding how all of them come and work together has been the most challenging part. Sometimes I feel like I am just copying exactly what the instructtor is doing without really understanding what is going on.

# module 3 
### What went well:
I felt like I could follow along with the lecture.

### Most challenging part:
I STILL don't have Twitter API access
