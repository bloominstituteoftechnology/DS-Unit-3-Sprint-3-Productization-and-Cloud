Day 1

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I am trying to follow along with Mike, but ultimately had to rewatch the video as I fell behind.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Having completed this project in DSPT2, It is interesting to see different ways of approaching the same thing.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Not understanding how we are going to create twitoff with how cluttered the code is. I definitely prefer making 
several files as we build versus the way we are working right now. I will probably watch Alex's videos to 
actually do my assignment, although I plan to watch and follow Michael too in a different directory. Twitoff will
be my actual project vs inclass_app.

Day 2

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I was able to keep up with Mike until some errors slowed me down. I was able to delete the file and re-clone it 
from Github at the last push when everything was still working and catch up.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Once again, the method Mike is using is very different from the last time I did this project. It's amazing how
many different ways the same concept can be created. Different paths to the same results and I understand how
both work.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

I had some problems with vs code, which were not allowing me to import flask or any other information. I was
able to fix it after a little research in the vs code documentation and was able to fix issues in both repos.

I also had some issues when Mike started cleaning up his code because he was moving too fast to follow what he
was doing, when watching the recording I had to slow it down to < normal in order to see what he did. I am still 
working in both repos but am prioritizing Twitoff.
