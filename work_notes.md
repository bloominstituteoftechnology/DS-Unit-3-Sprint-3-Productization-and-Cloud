# Day 1 - Web Application Development with Flask: 
Once you get the intuition of workflow, despite the huge amount of new information in short time, it is really fun. In the context of working on the assignment everything went well: the installation of packages was OK, I made a typo, so I just deleted the pipfile and I restarted the steps;  when running the flask app I got error because some typos in the .py files, really easy to find and fix. 

--------------------
# Day 2 - Consuming Data from an API
Things were going pretty well until embedding. I don't know if it is a problem with Basilica server, because I checked every step I made and I still get errors when embedding. I sent the screenshots with the errors to the channel, tomorrow I take care of this.
Update: many users got the same issue, after it was resolved the app worked well.
