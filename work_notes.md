# Unit 3 Sprint 4 Work Notes <br>

## Day 1
[Link to project repo](https://github.com/connorpheraty/TwitOff) <br> <br>
What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- I was able to follow along with the lecture with minimal issues. I created a repo and created the TwitOff package. I created the app.py script which enables me to create and connect to a local sqlite database. I then created the models.py script where I created the schema for the sql database. <br>

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- I particularly enjoyed using knowledge from both the first and second week of this unit. I am really beginning to form a well grounded understanding of how websites interact with databases. <br>

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- Understanding the syntax of Flask. More specifically, understanding why and how the app.py script works. It is critical in data science to understand how databases work with web applications. I will continue to try to gain a more well rounded understanding of this interaction.<br>

## Day 2

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- Today I better understood the concepts and syntax learned in day 1 (the routing syntax in particular). I was able to pick up HTML quickly as I have had prior experience with the language. I enjoyed working with multiple files in the repo and seeing everything work together. <br>

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
- I am fascinated by how embeddings work, and specifically how Basilica breaks down a string into hundreds of float values that can be analyzed and interpreted with a regression model. I enjoyed learning about how the different components of a web application interact with each other (frontend, backend, database). I look forward to having a more detailed understanding of this area. <br>

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
- The most challenging part of today (and in part yesterday) is developing a detailed mental model of how all of these files/components work together to form a working web application. I look forward to further studying the syntax of the different files of my package to further build upon my knowledge and understanding.

## Day 3
[Link to project repo](https://github.com/connorpheraty/TwitOff) <br> <br>

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
- My understanding of how my html templates interact with the underlying python code has improved. I was able to create my first data science web application! I was able to follow Jon-Cody and Aaron's lectures and had a decent understanding in regards to what they were doing. <br>

 What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
 - The most exciting part of today's assignment was running the website and seeing the application actually work! This is the first time that I was able to create a working data science related application from start to finish and I am amazed at the result (however trivial). <br>

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? 
- The most challenging part of the work today was debugging typos and little mistakes in my code. It is easy to be frustrated and lost when consistently getting errors. Attacking each problem with a cool head bit by bit, line by line can be difficult to do when working on the same problem for a long time. Standing up, doing exercise, and breathing some fresh air can help.
