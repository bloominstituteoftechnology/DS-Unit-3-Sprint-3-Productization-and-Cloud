# [bird-up](https://github.com/quinn-dougherty/bird-up)

## Monday
1. I was keeping up with lecture, had a little bit of debugging to do. Then I spent a little time doing "break it on purpose then fix it" exploration. Then I factored out the generation of toydata into a function/script and verified that it worked through the sqlite3 GUI desktop app. 
2. getting the basics of serving a python project through flask, surprising/parituclarly interesting because it was a little easier than I thought but still hard to sort of derive/stumblethru.  
3. The most challenging part was having to poke really precise commands at an API i know virtually nothing about. 

## Tuesday
1. I got everything moving during lecture
2. i really liked this other API i found called botometer
3. html when i don't really have an IDE set up for it.

## Wednesday
1. Got the app moving
2. Debugger 
3. Keeping on top of project while it grows 

## Thursday
1. the app is deployed!  
2. bugs -- finicky, weird bugs. 
3. directory and input structure, like sometimes putting `.` or `..` isn't enough. i'm starting to explore weird stuffl ike `from __future__` and `import sys` to work around importing files from other directories
