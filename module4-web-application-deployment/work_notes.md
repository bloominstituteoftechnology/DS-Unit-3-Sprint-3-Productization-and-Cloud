What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    Deployment was successful! Less painful than I expected.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    I played with Waitress a little. though I used Gunicorn for the deployment.
    Might have to try it for deployment at some other time.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    Deployment is new to me, and parsing the logs to find issues is a bit
    more of a trial than stack traces I've dealt with before.
    Good practice though.
