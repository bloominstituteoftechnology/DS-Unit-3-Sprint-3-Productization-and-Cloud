Thursday 12/05/19 What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I haven't begun working on the 2nd assignment because I am still trying to finish module 1. It is true that trying to get the code to work seems to be hard than writing the code itself. Installing Flask-SQLAlchemy was a beast.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Being able to build a database from the terminal line was a lot of fun. I have only used access in the past so seeing what goes on "under the hood" was enthralling. Still haven't got it to work on my end, but I will.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Getting a solid understanding of which terminal I should be working in to make things happen (git v python) I can't seem to to get python to work in git or vice versa. This has been an ongoing issue for me during this Unit.

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I was finally able to complete assignment one and added more to my project than requested. I have 4 users, and each user has 3 tweets assigned to them, which are actual quotes of things they've said.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I have worked in Access databases a lot. It was really interesting to see and delve into what was going on under the hood all that time.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Getting code to work, after trying to fix 100 other things, I finally discovered I had missed a space in my app.py. I will begin assignment 2 tomorrow and hope to have completed that assignment by Monday so that I am caught up to the rest of the class.
