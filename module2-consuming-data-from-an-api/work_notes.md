What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    database manipulation, API pulls were all straightforward.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    Environment variables - this is the first time I've really been exposed to them.
    I've sort of understood that variables can be assigned outside the Python shell,
    but hadn't really put two and two together.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    Nothing too challenging. Environment variables were the freshest thimg.
