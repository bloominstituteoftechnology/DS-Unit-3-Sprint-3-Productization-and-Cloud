- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?  
    High level concepts around what exactly a Flask app is finally clicked. Understanding what a flask app is, makes
    it much less scary and a little more intuitive.  
- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?  
    I thought API were interesting. Cool to see how to get data from certain websites that was different than just
    downloading a CSV file.  
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?  
    I still think the architecture of buildings these apps has been challenging. Specifically all the files and
    folders that we create for these programs. It has been a huge change from working in notebooks and I think there
    could be time dedicated to that. Its a little too late at this juncture, but that really should be discussed at the
    beginning of the unit.
