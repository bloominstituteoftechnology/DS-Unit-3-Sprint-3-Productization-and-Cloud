Finished lessons 1, 2, and 3

will need to get caught up on lesson 4 on Thursday and Friday due to schedule conflict

At the point where I have the webapp able to take a user name,
if the user is not in the DB then find tweets and add tweets with the user to the DB, 
if the user is in the DB display the user name and all tweets in the DB from that user.

Just added the simple Logistic Regression model,
takes 2 users and text to try and predict who is more likely to have said it between the 2 users,
queries the DB for each user and creates a numpy array from the embedings for each tweet in the DB,
stacks they on top of each other and concatenates labels as 0 and 1,
fits the LogisticRegression Model using the embeddings from the tweets in DB and labels,
uses BASILICA to embed the text to predict on,
returns a prediction based on the Logistic Regression model and the new embedding.

TODO:
-(MOST IMPORTANT) Get more tweets
-Demensionality reduction
-Train/Val/Test split
-Shuffle data
-decide on a scoring metric
-build a baseline to compare to
-try more powerful models
