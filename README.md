Building a full-stack application, backed by Data Science
--------------------

*Note* - assignments this week are all steps in a larger week-long project. They
are to be worked on in a repo you make with your own account, as instructed in
the first day. You should still fork this repo, and open a PR where you add a
`work_notes.md` file that includes a link to your project repo. You should then
update `work_notes.md` each day with the following:

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
I was able to reproduce what was done in lecture. It's great to able to join the app the created database.
- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Very interesting to see how so many tools working together make can create, load, and run the SQL database along with request made to the API.
- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
Understanding the workflow. There's a lot of pieces to put together and it takes time to sink in.
