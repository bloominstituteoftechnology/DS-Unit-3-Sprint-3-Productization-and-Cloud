# DS-Unit-3-Sprint-3-Productization-and-Cloud
Building a full-stack application, backed by Data Science
--------------------

*Note* - assignments this week are all steps in a larger week-long project. They
are to be worked on in a repo you make with your own account, as instructed in
the first day. You should still fork this repo, and open a PR where you add a
`work_notes.md` file that includes a link to your project repo. You should then
update `work_notes.md` each day with the following:

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I am trying to follow along with Mike, but ultimately had to rewatch the video as I fell behind.

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Having completed this project in DSPT2, It is interesting to see different ways of approaching the same thing. 

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Not understanding how we are going to create twitoff with how cluttered the code is. I definitely prefer making several files
as we build versus the way we are working right now. I will probably watch Alex's videos to actually do my assignment, although
I plan to watch and follow Michael too in a different directory. Twitoff will be my actual project vs inclass_app.
