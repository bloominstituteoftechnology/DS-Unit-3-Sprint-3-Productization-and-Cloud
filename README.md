Building a real deployed full-stack application, backed by Data Science
--------------------

*Note* - assignments this week are all steps in a larger week-long project. They
are to be worked on in a repo you make with your own account, as instructed in
the first day. You should still fork this repo, and open a PR where you add a
`work_notes.md` file that includes a link to your project repo. You should then
update `work_notes.md` each day with the following:

- What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Followed along with the assigment. 

- What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Working with SqlAlchemy and using a database in a web application.

- What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
I want to understand the foundations of why code went where so that I can use what I learned to apply to different situations.
