# Work Notes.

### What went well today?
I learned how to set up a basic flask app the a rendered HTML
page and read/write access to a database.

### What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic today?
I have done this before so thankfully nothing surprising.

### What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
The most challenging bit was working with the database to do queries. 
Just messed around a bit and it's not too difficult.
