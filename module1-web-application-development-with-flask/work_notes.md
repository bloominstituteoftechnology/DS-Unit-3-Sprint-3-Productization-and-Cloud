was able to recreate the lecture. Got very lost during lecture, when connecting to the database. Was able to go back and get that working. 
Now need to figure out how to add new models for the tweets and users. That part is confusing as lecture we just copied and pasted, but dont really feel like we went over what exactly those classes in the model.py file are actually doing.
