What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
    Most things - writing the actual app, shelling in and making entries, etc.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
    The way in which SQLAlchemy handles a great deal of the legwork, including backreferencing different data classes to one another.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
    Items of trouble were - not running the program in the proper directory, and misspelling a keyword in the database connection.
