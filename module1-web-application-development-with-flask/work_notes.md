What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?

I ran into some errors so I wasn't able to code along with him fairly early in the second half of class. I will watch Bruno's video to get a better understanding of the information.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

I love the idea of making something my friends can use.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?

Trying to keep up with Alex. As I said before, when I ran into an error, I wasn't able to catch up and he had already cleared his terminal screen. I will rewatch the same lecture with a different instructor and hopefully gain a better understanding.

What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today? 

Everything went well so far. Seeing my code make something in a browser window had me absolutely tickled.

What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?

Learning how to use basic and semi- advance changes to the text in the browser was too fun and I spent way to much time on it. But I now have a solid understanding of  basic html tags and color schemes.

What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why? I got stuck on installing and using flask-sqlalchemy...I am still stuck.

Continues in Module 2 of this sprint.
