###What went well (in the context of working on the assignment) today?
Building up an app during class mad a lot of sense today. I liked getting to apply the knowledge of functions and classes in a more practical way.

###What was particularly interesting or surprising about the topic(s) today?
Honestly I was surprised about how easy it was to go from nothing to a deployed web app. Flask is definitely a really cool tool that I'm excited to continue working with and learning more about.

###What was the most challenging part of the work today, and why?
getting data into the database behind flask was challenging but after figuring out the basics from a quick-start tutorial I was able to write a function to abstract away the challenging parts.
