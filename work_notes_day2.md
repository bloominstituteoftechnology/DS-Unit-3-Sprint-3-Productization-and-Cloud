1. Things went well in general I was able to access the Twitter API and Basilica API
2. What was super cool was accessing Basilica's API embeddings through the command line and inputting it into
our DataBase.
3. The most challenging part was trying to keep up with the pace of information being presented in the limited
amount of time we have.
